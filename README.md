# Blockchain in JavaScript

This is a simple blockchain that I wrote in JavaScript to understand some of the fundamentals of blockchain. The excellent tutorial for this blockchain is made by [Savjee](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ) and can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&t=6s).

## How to run the script
The script uses Node.js to run. If you do not have Node.js installed, download and install from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once Node.js is installed, open the terminal, navigate to the Blockchain_in_JavaScript directory and run `node main.js.`

You should be able to see the outputs in the terminal.
